    <h1>Climate Change Conspiracies</h1>
    <h2>Theorists Say:</h2>
    <h3>Climate change is natural, not caused by human error</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Over at least the past million years, glacial and interglacial cycles have been triggered by variations in how much sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere in the summer, which are driven by small variations in the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Climate change is real, but doesn’t matter as much as people say it does.</h3>
    <h3>Models used for climate change are unreliable</h3>
    <h2>Counterarguments</h2>
    <h3>Global temp averages have increased:</h3>

    <h3>427 billion metric tons of ice sheets melt every year</h3>
    <h3>Ocean Warming</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat energy in the ocean has increased by 337 zettajoules</li>
      <li>The effects of ocean warming include sea level rise due to thermal expansion, coral bleaching, accelerated melting of Earth’s major ice sheets, intensified hurricanes, and changes in ocean health and biochemistry.</li>
